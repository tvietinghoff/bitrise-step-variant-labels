summary: |
  Extracts labels from PR and derives build variants to build from it
description: |
  When merging a PR, this step evaluates the labels on the github / gitlab PR and generates a list of Android gradle 
  build variants based on the labels set. Multiple flavor dimensions can be set. The labels to recognize are configured in 
  the step. 
  
  gitlab only (currently): If you configure the gitlab project ID, this step can also be used outside of a merge request
  context. If there is no merge request applicable, the commit message will be parsed for sections like these:
  
  `[label: <comma-separated labels>]`
  
  E.g. `[label: build_release, flavor_green, flavor_red]`

  - variant_labels:
    opts:
      title: "variant labels"
      summary: The labels to use for generating the variant names
      description: |
        Variant labels specifies PR label names that will designate flavors to build. Multiple flavor
        dimensions can be specified by separating a flavor list with `|`. Prefixing a label name with `!` will select
        it as the flavor of the respective dimension if no labels for that dimension are set at the PR. There can be
        only one default flavor per dimension.

        There are two ways of specifing a flavor dimension, only one of which can be used within each dimension.

        - `[[!]<label1>=]<value1>[,[<label2>=]<value2>...]`
            - specifies a list of labels with optional flavor value mapping. If no mapping is specified, the label itself
          will be taken as the name of the flavor. If the label is prefixed with '!', it will be used as the default if
          none of the labels are found in the PR.

        - `<glob_pattern>`[,!<default>]`
          - specifies a pattern (containing  the '*' wildcard character) which will be matched against the label names
          and will subsitute the part represented by the wildcard as the flavor in this dimension. The optional default
          value will be used if no matching labels are found in the PR.

          Examples
        - `full,demo`
          - looks for the labels `full` and `demo` and selects either one as a build flavor. If none is set,
          the step fails

        - `full,!demo`
          - looks for the labels full and demo and selects either one as a build flavor. If none is set,
          demo will be selected

        - `full,!demo|orange,blue,!teal`
          - two dimensions. With a label set of "blue" and "orange" this will select the
          flavor combinations `demoBlue` and `demoOrange`

        - `flavor_*`
          - with labels `flavor_blue` and `flavor_red` set, will select the flavors `red` and `blue`. If none are set,
        the step fails.

        - `flavor_*,!orange`
          - with no labels matching `flavor_*` set, will select the flavor `orange`

        NB: although this is targeted for selecting flavors, it can just as well be applied to build types. Just make
          sure to specify the build type as the last dimension.

  - variant_patterns:
    opts:
      title: "variant patterns"
      summary: A list of pattern specifications used to build environment variables, separated by `|`
      description: |
        A pattern specification is a pair of the environment variable to set and a pattern to generate the value from:
        `{key}={pattern}[;{separator}]`

        The pattern should include one placeholder "#n" for the selected flavor of the n-th dimension.
        Specifying a sepatator is optional. The default separator is space.

        Example:
        `VARIANTS=#1Release`  -> with selected flavors full and demo, this exports the environment variable `VARIANTS`
        with the Value `fullRelease demoRelease`

        `GRADLE_TASK=assemble#1#2Release;,` -> with selected flavors full of dimension 1 and blue / orange of dimension 2,
        this exports the environment variable `GRADLE_TASK` with the value `assembleFullBlueRelease,assembleFullOrangeRelease`
        (camelCasing the variant names is done automatically)

        `VARIANTS=#1Release` -> with flavor label specification `trial=demo,full` and PR label `trial` set, this
        exports the environment variable `VARIANTS` withe the value `demoRelease`

        The dimension index is one-based and determined by the order of the dimension in the variant_labels specification.

        Export the pull request description to a file so it can be included e.g. in the version notes. Expects the path
        to the file to export the description to. The file can have .html or .txt extension, which will determine which
        description format is stored. If no extension is given, both formats will be exported by appending .html and .txt
        to the path respectively.

  - labels2env:
    opts:
      title: "Set environment variables based on PR labels"
      description: |
        Matches labels with environment label specifications, e.g. `skip_dist=yes,dist_*=distribute` and generates environment
        variables thereof.

        Label specification types:

        `some_label`: If "some_label" is set in labels, generates an environment variable `some_label` with the content
        	`some_label`

        `some_label=value`: If "some_label" is set in labels, generates an environment variable `some_label` with the content
        	`value`

        `prefix_*`: If any label matching "prefix_*" is found, generates an environment variable with the name and content
        	of what the placeholder * represents.
        	Example: `dist_*`
        		When labels `dist_internal` and `dist_external` are set at the PR, this will create the following variables:
        		`internal=internal`
        		`external=external`

        `prefix_*=key`: If any label matching `prefix_*` is found, sets the environment variable named `key` with the
        	content being a comma-separated list of all values that were found represented by the * placeholder.
        
        	Example: `dist_*=distribute`
        		When labels `dist_internal` and `dist_external` are set at the PR, this will create the following variable:
        		`distribute=internal,external`
        
            This can as well be used to create an environment variable holding the comma-separated list of all set labels
            like this:
        
            `*=pr_labels`
                will set an environment variable `pr_labels` that contains all labels set in the PR.

        This is needed for accessing gitlab via API, e.g. when build labels need to be configured via commit message
        as opposed to merge request labels (Commit information is accessed with the REST API as opposed to the merge
        request information which is obtained via GraphQL).
